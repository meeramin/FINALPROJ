1. Follower Counts of the top N actors in the Movie on Social Media (Twitter)
2. Looking at the # of comments and # views on trailer videos for the movies on youtube
3. IMDB Rating and Box Office as Reported on IMDB

## Data Colletion

Start with a list of movies. We choose to look at various movies from 2019 so that box office information and also social media engagement is established and not too differentiated by time.

We chose a premade playlist of ~150 Movies From Youtube. As this helped keep the data easy to access

We will collect Movie Title, Movie Rating (IMDB), Box Office, Top Actor/Actress, Release Date, and Genre

From Twitter we will collect follower counts from the Top Actors in the Movie

From Youtube we will gather data on the # Views and the # Comments.
